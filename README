THIS CODE IS PURELY MINE, BUT IS ALLOWED TO USE, IF CREDITED.
This code is made for my study area project (SOP, Studie Omr√•de Projekt).
In this code I try to make a Machine Learning model that can read handwriting based on numbers and letters drawn by hand.
So far it's still in its prototype with recognizing numbers.
